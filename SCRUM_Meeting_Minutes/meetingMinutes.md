# SCRUM Meeting minutes
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WSpF12QC6ngRVm-wY1Dg5f6evlgZ2TMK4O29R8ocZuU/edit?usp=sharing) is the google doc that we  used to record the meeting minutes.

## 10/28/2019
1. Till now our progress is less than expected. We were stuck in some technological issues. For instance, our knowledge over node.js is not at an advanced stage.  
2. We wanted to merge branches individually and thatâ€™s why a lot of conflicts occurred. So now we have decided to merge the conflicts together so that such conflicts can be handled efficiently.
3. We have to arrange more scrum meetings in a week. Now we decide to meet in every alternate day. This increases accountability in each of us and everyone remains in check and balance by others in the group.

## 10/30/2019
1. The implementation of extracting data from a dblp profile has to be redone. It did not comply with the purpose of what we want to do.
2. We have to understand the promise API.

## 11/1/2019
1. We overestimated the progress of the project, that is why there are still some tasks in the to do list. 
2. Two of the tasks are already done. We just need to close those issues.
3. The API of LinkedIn was restricted unlike GitHub or DBLP. That is why extracting data from LinkedIn profile according to the bot API was a time consuming process. So we had to change the approach by which we want to extract the data. 

## 11/2/2019
1. Yaml verification and validation tasks will be postponed as it is a part of alternative path
2. Priority is to finish all the happy path functionalities.

## 11/3/2019
1. Currently facing problems to first unzip a folder and deleting a file inside a particular directory in that folder. Need to study callback, async-await and promise in node.js.
2. Completed creating a git repo using npm and push it to the repository using node.js.
3. Issue# 39 (Merge all data into a single json and then convert it to yml) is requiring significant time and effort. Therefore, we have decided to complete this issue by pair programming.
4. We intend to finish all the modular functionalities by Tuesday because integrating all these tasks to make a functional bot is assumed to require a significant amount of time.

## 11/8/2019
1. We have completed all the tasks (except for refactoring modules) in the project board. 
2. We discovered some bugs. In our next iteration we are going to fix it.
3. We plan to refactor the codes in each of our modules.
4. We are exploring the technologies for deployment.
5. Our working codes are in the experimental branch right now.

## 11/14/2019
1. We plan to refactor our conversation. We plan to remove the unnecessary parts and add some more useful instructions for a user to use. 
2. The bot should be able to retrieve the state of the user from the database if he says no when the bot asks if the user wants to create a new conversation.
3. The profile picture still does not show on user's homepage. We plan to fix this.
